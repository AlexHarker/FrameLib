DONE

1 - can I find what units I'm connected to at construct time?
2 - how do I minimise buffering? - use control for any non-audio handling objects!

IN PROGRESS -> PROOF OF CONCEPT (requires finessing)

3 - how do I pass parameters in?  / fixed inputs with more than one value?              SERVER COMMANDS WORK

OUTSTANDING

4 - where do I store the global object so it is retrievable (from the world)?
5 - how can I safely and reliably tell if a unit is a framelib thing?
6 - auto synchronisation
7 - memory management
8 - how can I deal with variable numbers of outputs/inputs?
9 - error reporting
