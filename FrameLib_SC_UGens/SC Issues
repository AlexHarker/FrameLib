DONE

1 - can I find what units I'm connected to at construct time?
2 - how do I minimise buffering? - use control for any non-audio handling objects!
3 - how can I safely and reliably tell if a unit is a framelib thing? - use calc functions stored in the global!
4 - how do I pass parameters in? - use FLParam object
5 - where do I store the global object so it is retrievable - use FLParam object

IN PROGRESS -> PROOF OF CONCEPT (requires finessing)
 
6 - auto synchronisation                           	REVERSE DIRECTION (needs testing)
7 - error reporting					USE PRINT (needs proxy details etc.)
	
OUTSTANDING

8 - how do I pass fixed inputs with more than one value?      
9 - how can I deal with variable numbers of outputs/inputs?
10 - memory management (including FFT allocations)
