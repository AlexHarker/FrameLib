DONE

1 - can I find what units I'm connected to at construct time?
2 - how do I minimise buffering? - use control for any audio handling objects!

IN PROGRESS -> PROOF OF CONCEPT (requires finessing)

3 - how do I pass parameters in?              SERVER COMMANDS WORK
4 - fixed inputs with more than one value?    USE SAME MECHANISM FOR PARAMS - WORKS SERVER SIDE

OUTSTANDING

5 - where do I store the global object so it is retrievable (from the world)?
6 - how can I safely and reliably tell if a unit is a framelib thing?
7 - auto synchronisation
8 - memory management
9 - how can I deal with variable numbers of outputs/inputs?
10 - error reporting
