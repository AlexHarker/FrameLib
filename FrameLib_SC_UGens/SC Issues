DONE

1 - can I find what units I'm connected to at construct time?
2 - how do I minimise buffering? - use control for any non-audio handling objects!

IN PROGRESS -> PROOF OF CONCEPT (requires finessing)

3 - how do I pass parameters in?  / fixed inputs with more than one value?         SERVER COMMANDS WORK
4 - auto synchronisation                                                           REVERSE DIRECTION (needs testing)
OUTSTANDING

5 - where do I store the global object so it is retrievable (from the world)?
6 - how can I safely and reliably tell if a unit is a framelib thing?
7 - memory management
8 - how can I deal with variable numbers of outputs/inputs?
9 - error reporting
