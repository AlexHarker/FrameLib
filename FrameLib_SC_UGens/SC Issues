DONE

1 - can I find what units I'm connected to at construct time?
2 - how do I minimise buffering? - use control for any non-audio handling objects!
3 - how can I safely and reliably tell if a unit is a framelib thing? - use calc functions stored in the global!

IN PROGRESS -> PROOF OF CONCEPT (requires finessing)

4 - how do I pass parameters in?  / fixed inputs with more than one value?      SERVER COMMANDS WORK BUT ARE TEMPORARY
5 - auto synchronisation                                                        REVERSE DIRECTION (needs testing)
6 - error reporting								USE PRINT (needs proxy details etc.)
	
OUTSTANDING

7 - where do I store the global object so it is retrievable (from the world)?	Possible use of ServerTree actions
8 - memory management
9 - how can I deal with variable numbers of outputs/inputs?
