Packages are a convenient means of bundling objects, media, patchers, and resources for distribution.

A package is simply a folder adhering to a prescribed structure and placed in the 'packages' folder.  Folders adhering to this structure can be accessed by Max to integrate seamlessly at launch time.

To install a package, simply copy it to your 'packages' folder.
To uninstall a package, simply remove it from your 'packages' folder.

There are two packages folders you may use.
One is called 'packages' in your Max folder.
The other is the 'Max/Packages' in your Documents (Mac) or My Documents (Windows) folder.
