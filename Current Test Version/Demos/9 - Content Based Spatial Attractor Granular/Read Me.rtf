This patch is a granular synthesis tool that spatialises each grain in 3d based on audio feature analysis of the grain contents.\
\
It is configured to work in a 16 channel dome (8 / 6 / 2 in layers of height)\
However, you can get some idea in stereo by placing the attractors in the frontal arc and not using the height dimension.\
\
1 - Load some audio file.\
2 - Switch DSP on.\
3 - Double click on the spatial attractors interface to add attractors (you can remove with the buttons)\
4 - modify standard granular synthesis params\
4 - Modify the attractors setting to determine position and which grains will be attracted to them \
	- (set the feature and an appropriate target value - note the sfm is reported in dB)\
	- range sets the mapping range for the parameter (for frequency based descriptors this is in octaves, otherwise it is absolute)\
	-  curvature modifies the attraction of the descriptor (+ve means more towards / - ve means push away)\
	- weight sets weighting relative to other attractors\
	- randomness introduces randomness to the positioning (1 is totally random)\
	- the display beneath the UI shows the history of grain attraction to this attractor (high means very attracted / low means not at all)\
5 - spatial mappings calculate the positioning of sounds differently. Mapping 2 will give the most stable focussed positioning\
