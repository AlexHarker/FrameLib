# convhull_3d

A header only C implementation of the 3-D Quickhull algorithm for building Convex Hulls. The code is also compliant with MSVC and C++ compilers.

**New! As of 28.05.2021:** Added support for building N-dimensional Convex hulls and Delaunay meshes.

## Getting Started

To use this 3-D Convex Hull implementation in a '.c' or '.cpp' file, first add the following:

```c
#define CONVHULL_3D_ENABLE
#include "convhull_3d.h"
```

Then specify the vertices, which can be optionally extracted from an '.obj' file using the following code:

```c
ch_vertex* vertices = NULL;
int nVertices;
extract_vertices_from_obj_file(OBJ_FILE_NAME, &vertices, &nVertices);
/* Where 'vertices' is a vector of vertices [nVertices].x, .y, .z  */
```

where 'OBJ_FILE_NAME' is the '.obj' file path (without the extension).

Or they may be defined manually, for example: a random distribution of points on the unit sphere:

```c
int n = 936;
ch_vertex* vertices;
vertices = (ch_vertex*)malloc(n*sizeof(ch_vertex));
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    float elev = rand()/(float)RAND_MAX * M_PI * 2.0;
    float azi = rand()/(float)RAND_MAX * M_PI * 2.0;
    vertices[i].x = cos(azi) * cos(elev) * rand()/(float)RAND_MAX;
    vertices[i].y = sin(azi) * cos(elev) * rand()/(float)RAND_MAX;
    vertices[i].z = sin(elev);
}
```

The Convex Hull may then be built and subsequently exported (including face normals) as an '.obj' file, using this code:

```c
int* faceIndices = NULL;
int nFaces;
convhull_3d_build(vertices, nVertices, &faceIndices, &nFaces);
/* Where 'faceIndices' is a flat 2D matrix [nFaces x 3] */
convhull_3d_export_obj(vertices, nVertices, faceIndices, nFaces, 1, OUTPUT_OBJ_FILE_NAME);
free(vertices);
free(faceIndices);
```

where 'OUTPUT_OBJ_FILE_NAME' is the output '.obj' file path (without the extension).

### Additional options

By default, the implementation uses double floating point precision to build the hull, while still exporting the results in single floating point precision. However, one may configure convhull_3d to use single precision to build the hull (which is less accurate and reliable, but quicker) by adding the following:
```c
#define CONVHULL_3D_USE_SINGLE_PRECISION /* (optional) */
#define CONVHULL_3D_ENABLE
#include "convhull_3d.h"
```

If your project has CBLAS linked, then you may also speed up the matrix multiplications by adding:
```c
#define CONVHULL_3D_USE_CBLAS /* (optional) */
#define CONVHULL_3D_USE_SINGLE_PRECISION /* (optional) */
#define CONVHULL_3D_ENABLE
#include "convhull_3d.h"
```

## Test

This repository contains files: 'test/test_convhull_3d.c' and 'test/test_script.m'. The former can be used to generate Convex Hulls of the '.obj' files located in the 'test/obj_files' folder, which can be subsequently verified in MatLab using the latter file; where the 'convhull_3d.h' implementation is compared with MatLab's built-in 'convhull' function, side-by-side. Furthermore, Visual Studio 2017 and Xcode project files have been included in the 'test' folder for convenience.

## Examples

The 'test/test_convhull_3d.c' file may also serve as example usage of the convhull_3d implementation. The following images are of the original 'obj' files (left) and the corresponding Convex Hulls (right), depicted using Tim Maxwell's OBJ Viewer:
