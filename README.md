FrameLib
========

A DSP framework for arbitrary size frame processing with arbitrary sub-sample accurate timing.

FrameLib currently provides:
    - A framework written in C++11 for frame-based processing
    - A set of objects for processing frames
    - Bindings for cycling 74's Max and for puredata (pd)
    
FrameLib can be compiled and bound to any environment that processes audio in blocks.
