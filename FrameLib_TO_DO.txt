DONE 	1 - Methods of dealing with fixed input values (and modes related to this)

2 - Finalise Max Wrapper
DONE	- Make C++ class extensible
	- Review entry of inputs and attributes
	- Make safe (avoid direct access of other objects / thread safety / avoid symbol bindings)
	- Better connection issue reporting

3 - Review parameter inputs (how to handle, including max wrapper)

4 - Finalise Memory Management
	- Do variable memory management (underlying engine)
	- Review memory management

5 - Revise, refactor and cleanup
	- Max Object Work
	- Block / DSP
	- Attribute
	- Memory
	- Global / Common
	- Multichannel

6 - Assist/Help Info (Inputs and Parameters)

7 - Error Reporting (Realtime and push to wrapper)

8 - Methods of dealing with data storage and retrieval (a la coll etc.) and also buffers (abstract out?)

PROGRESS	9 - Fixed Point Division / Fixed Point Time Format

10 - Multi threading work (Memory / DSP / Attributes / DSP Queue / Connection)
