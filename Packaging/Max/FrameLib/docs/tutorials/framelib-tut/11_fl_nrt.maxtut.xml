  <subhead>This tutorial outlines how to work with non-realtime FrameLib networks.</subhead>
  <body>So far in this tutorial series we've been concerned with realtime FrameLib networks. Every network can be made to work in non-realtime, meaning processing happens as fast as possible and independent from the main audio thread. In many cases minimal changes need to be made to an existing graph of objects, and this tutorial will guide you through these modifications.</body>
