	"description": "A DSP framework for arbitrary size frame processing with arbitrary sub-sample accurate timing. FrameLib in Max allows for explorations of multi-rate processing suited to complex granular or spectral applications. It supports realtime or non-realtime audio processing (with buffer~s as IO), and multithreaded operation.",
