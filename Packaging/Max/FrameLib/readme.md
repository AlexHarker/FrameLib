FrameLib
========

A DSP framework for arbitrary size frame processing with arbitrary sub-sample accurate timing.

* Frame timing and length can vary freely across networks and over time.

* FrameLib supports multi-threaded processing in real-time or non real-time.

FrameLib might be useful for:
---------------------------------
- Granular or spectral processing applications or more generally for multirate processing

- Working in cycling 74's Max with advanced spectral or multirate processing

- Prototyping or rapid development of frame-based DSP chains
